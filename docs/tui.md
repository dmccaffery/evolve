# TUI

On an interactive terminal, `evolve run triggers`, `run evals` and `run all` open a full-screen TUI: first a **selection
form** to scope the run, then a **live dashboard** that streams results as agents finish. Pass `--no-tui` (or set
`EVOLVE_NO_TUI=1`) for the plain line-based output used in CI and non-TTY pipes — both paths drive the same engine, so
the run is identical either way.

## Selection form

![The Evolve selection form](assets/form.png){ loading=lazy }

A set of focusable panes you tab between to choose what runs:

- **Filters** — the same `new` / `modified` / `failed` scoping the run flags expose.
- **Harnesses** — the agent CLIs to drive; any whose CLI is off `PATH` is shown disabled.
- **Models** — individual models grouped under a per-provider header row, so you can toggle one model or a whole
  provider at once. Models unsupported by the enabled harnesses are shown disabled.
- **Plugins / Skills / Cases** — a tree of every trigger and behavioral case. Each row shows whether it is forced on,
  forced off, or auto-queued for all / some / none of the enabled models; a legend under the tree names every glyph.

| Keys                                         | Action                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ++tab++ / ++shift+tab++                      | Move left or right between panes |
| ++1++–++4++                                  | Jump straight to a pane          |
| ++arrow-up++ ++arrow-down++ / ++j++ ++k++    | Move up or down within a pane    |
| ++arrow-left++ ++arrow-right++ / ++h++ ++l++ | Collapse or expand the tree      |
| ++space++                                    | Toggle the selected row          |
| ++g++ / ++shift+g++                          | Jump to top or bottom            |
| ++r++                                        | Start the run                    |
| ++esc++                                      | Quit without running             |

The form previews exactly what will execute — it and the engine resolve through the same plan, so they cannot drift.

## Live dashboard

Once a run starts, the dashboard streams progress:

- A **title bar** with running pass / fail / error tallies, elapsed time, rolled-up cost, and an overall progress bar.
- An **Execution** tree (plugin → skill → model → case) carrying per-node rollup columns.
- A tabbed **Rollup** (Summary / Providers / Plugins / Skills), a **Runs** log of every execution in plan order, and a
  **Details** pane showing in-flight cases and the selected case's authored spec.

Selecting a run in any pane moves the selection everywhere.

| Keys                    | Action                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ++f++                   | Follow the live execution      |
| ++enter++               | Open the selected run's detail |
| ++g++ / ++shift+g++     | Jump to top or bottom          |
| ++ctrl+d++ / ++ctrl+u++ | Scroll down or up a page       |
