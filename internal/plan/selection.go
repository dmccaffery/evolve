// State is a node's selection intent. Partial (the zero value) follows the
// preselect baseline (Needs) — what a --new/--failed/--modified sweep seeds, and
// the default for any node the form has not explicitly toggled; Off excludes the
// node; On widens it to run everywhere it applies (every selected model, or every
// selected case). The form mutates these as the user toggles rows.
