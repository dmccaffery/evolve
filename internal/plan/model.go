package plan

// Plan is the ordered tree of work a sweep will execute, in execution order:
// plugin → skill → model (provider-spec order) → unit (all triggers before all
// evals) → case (authored order). It is the single description of what runs, for
// which models, in what order — built by Build, executed by the engine, and
// rendered by the form (as a live preview) and the dashboard.
type Plan struct {
	Plugins []Plugin
}

// Plugin groups a plugin's skills.
type Plugin struct {
	Name   string
	Skills []Skill
}

// Skill groups one skill's models.
type Skill struct {
	Skill  string
	Title  string
	Models []Model
}

// Model is one provider/model under a skill, carrying its trigger and eval units.
type Model struct {
	Key     string // "provider/model"
	Display string
	Units   []Unit
}

// Unit is one tier (triggers or evals) of a model, with its ordered cases.
type Unit struct {
	Ref   UnitRef
	Cases []Case
}

// Case is one authored trigger query or eval, resolved for its model: Queued
// reports whether it runs this session, and the prior fields carry the last
// committed result (so a non-queued case renders read-only and a queued one tints
// its pending indicator by how it did last time).

	Kind          Kind
	ShouldTrigger bool // triggers only: expected to fire
	Queued        bool // resolved: will run this session, for this model

	HasPrior    bool
	PriorStatus Status
	Prior       ItemMetrics
}

// Filters derives the per-model execution filter from the plan's queued cases —
// the run set the engine executes, keyed by model. A model with no queued case is
// omitted, so the engine skips it. This is the bridge from the resolved plan back
// to the Filter the sweep consumes, so execution runs exactly what the plan shows.
